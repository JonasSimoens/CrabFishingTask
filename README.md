The directory "Simulations" contains the code I used to test whether the models I fitted on the behavioural data could be reliably differentiated fro each other given the experimental design as well as the code I used to test whether the parameters of the model that fitted the behavioural data best could be reliably estimated given the experimental design.

The directory "Experiment" contains the code I used to collect behavioural data online as well as the code I used to collect behavioural and fMRI data at the university hospital.

The directory "Analyses" contains the code I used to analyse the behavioural data using hierarchical Bayesian model estimation as well as the code I used to analyse the fMRI data using representational similarity analyses.
